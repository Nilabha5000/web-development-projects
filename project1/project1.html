    <h2>Introduction of Operating System.</h2>
    <p>
        An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware.<br> 
        The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment
         in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. 
    </p>

    <p>
        An operating system is software that manages computer hardware. 
        The hardware must provide<br> appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user <br>
        programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system. 
        A more common definition is that the<br> operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel),<br> 
        with all else being application programs.
    </p>

     <p>
        An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, 
        such as memory,<br> processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes 
        programs to<br> manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/">memory management</a> module, 
        I/O<br> programs, and a file system.
    </p>

     <h2>Characteristics of Operating Systems</h2>
     <p>Let us now discuss some of the important characteristic features of operating systems:</p>

     <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Device Management: The operating system keeps track of all the devices. So, 
                it is also called the <br>
                <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/i-o-scheduling-in-operating-systems/">Input/Output controller</a> 
                that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            File Management: It allocates and de-allocates the resources and also decides who gets the resource.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Job Accounting: It keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs or users.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Error-detecting Aids: These contain methods that include the production of dumps, traces, error<br> messages, 
                and other debugging and error-detecting methods.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Memory Management: It keeps track of the <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/primary-memory/">primary memory</a>, like what part of it is in use by whom,
                 or <br> part is not in use, etc. and It also allocates the memory when a process or program requests it.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Processor Management: It allocates the processor to a process and then de-allocates the processor<br>
                 when it is no longer required or the job is done.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Control on System Performance: It records the delays between the request for a service and the<br> system.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

                Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used efficiently.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Ability to Evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing,<br> 
                and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Throughput: An OS should be constructed so that It can give maximum throughput (Number of tasks per unit time).
            </p>
        </li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Functionalities of Operating System</h2>

     <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Resource Management: When parallel accessing happens in the OS means when multiple users are<br> accessing
                 the system the OS works as Resource Manager, 
                 Its responsibility is to provide hardware to <br>the user. It decreases the load in the system.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Process Management: It includes various tasks like scheduling and termination of the process. 
                It is done with the help of <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/">CPU Scheduling algorithms.</a>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Storage Management: The file system mechanism used for the management of the storage. 
                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-nfs-and-cifs/">NIFS,</a><br>
                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-nfs-and-cifs/">CIFS,</a> CFS, NFS, etc. are some file systems. 
                All the data is stored in various tracks of Hard disks that<br> are all managed by the storage manager. 
                It included <b>Hard Disk.</b>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Memory Management: Refers to the management of primary memory. 
                The operating system has to <br> keep track of how much memory has been used and by whom. 
                It has to decide which process needs <br> memory space and how much. 
                OS also has to allocate and deallocate the memory space.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Security/Privacy Management: Privacy is also provided by the Operating system using passwords 
                so <br> that unauthorized applications canâ€™t access programs or data. For example, 
                Windows uses <b>Kerberos</b><br> authentication to prevent unauthorized access to data.
            </p>
        </li>
     </ul>


     <p>The process operating system as User Interface: </p>
     <ol>
        <li>User</li>
        <li>System and application programs</li>
        <li>Operating system</li>
        <li>Hardware</li>
     </ol>
     <p>
        Every general-purpose computer consists of hardware, an operating system(s), system programs,<br> 
        and application programs. The hardware consists of memory, CPU, ALU, I/O devices, peripheral devices, and <br>
         storage devices. The system program consists of compilers, loaders,
         editors, OS, etc. The application <br> program consists of business programs and database programs. 
     </p>

     <p>
        Every computer must have an operating system to run other programs. 
        The operating system coordinates <br> the use of the hardware among the various system programs and application programs for various users. <br>
        It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work. 
     </p>
      <p>
        The operating system is a set of special programs that run on a computer system that allows it to <br>work properly.
         It performs basic tasks such as recognizing input from the keyboard, keeping track of files and <br> directories on the disk, 
         sending output to the display screen, and controlling peripheral devices. 
      </p>
      <h2>Layered Design of Operating System</h2>
      <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231206144203/Os.png" width = "500" alt="Layered OS">

      <p>
        The extended machine provides operations like context save, dispatching, swapping, and I/O initiation. <br> The operating system layer is located on top of the extended machine layer. 
        This arrangement <br> considerably simplifies the coding and testing of OS modules by separating the algorithm of a function <br> from the implementation of its primitive operations.
         It is now easier to test, debug, and modify an OS <br> module than in a monolithic OS. 
         We say that the lower layer provides an abstraction that is the extended <br>machine. We call the operating system layer the top layer of the OS.
      </p>

      <h2>Purposes and Tasks of Operating Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Several tasks are performed by the Operating Systems and it also helps in serving a lot of purposes <br> which are mentioned below.
         We will see how Operating System helps us in serving in a better way with <br> the help of the task performed by it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Purposes of an Operating System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
